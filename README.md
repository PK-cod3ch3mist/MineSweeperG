# MineSweeper v1.5
This is actually an improved GUI version for the CLI minesweeper I made

## Dependencies
The CMake file should tell you that, but anyway, you require
* A C++ compiler, one supporting C++11 would be good. You could install G++/GCC or Clang or MinGW
* SFML libraries/API. For linux users this is easy, simply use your package manager, (for example in Ubuntu)
```shell
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
for MacOS users I would recommend doing the same using homebrew. 
```shell
brew install sfml
```
For detailed instructions, visit https://www.sfml-dev.org
* CMake. This can be installed using package managers for linux users, and using homebrew for MacOS users

## Gameplay
Well it is minesweeper, you will figure it out easily enough
